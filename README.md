<h1>Java Maven JDBC Library Project</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Java Maven JDBC Library project! Before you begin working with the project, make sure you have all the necessary tools installed. To smoothly work with the project, we recommend following these steps:</p>

<!-- Step 1: Install Java Compiler -->
<h2>1. Install Java Compiler</h2>
<p>Ensure that you have the Java compiler installed on your computer. You can check this by executing the following command in your command line:</p>
<code>java -version</code>
<p>If you see information about the installed Java version, it means the compiler is already installed. Otherwise, you need to install it. Visit the official Java website (https://www.java.com) and follow the instructions provided on the website to install the latest version of Java.</p>

<!-- Step 2: Download and Install Git -->
<h2>2. Download and Install Git</h2>
<p>To clone the project from the Git repository, you need to have Git client installed. Visit the official Git website (https://git-scm.com) and follow the instructions provided on the website to install the Git client. Once Git is installed, you can use it in the command line.</p>

<!-- Step 3: Choose Code Editor -->
<h2>3. Choose a Code Editor</h2>
<p>The Java Maven JDBC Library project can be edited using any code editor of your choice. However, for full functionality and convenience, I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA. It is an advanced Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java that offers many features to facilitate your work with the project. You can download and install IntelliJ IDEA from the website (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). There is also a free version called IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, which includes basic features and is suitable for most users.</p>

<!-- Step 4: Clone the Project -->
<h2>4. Clone the Project</h2>
<p>To start working with the project, execute the following command in the command line:</p>
<code>git clone https://github.com/sanetro/Java-maven-jdbc-library-project.git</code>
<p>This will clone the project repository to your local computer.</p>

<!-- Step 5: Open the Project in Maven tool -->
<h2>5. Open the Project in Maven tool</h2>
<p>To open the project using the Maven tool manager in IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch IntelliJ IDEA and choose "Open" from the welcome screen or select "File" > "Open" from the menu.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the path where the project was cloned (step 4).</li>
  <li>Select the "pom.xml" file and click "Open".</li>
  <li>Once the project is loaded, IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect that it is a Maven project and launch the Maven file manager.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In order to run the application successfully, you need to have a suitable database with the required tables. Please ensure that you have set up the database environment properly before running the application.</p>

<p>Great! Now you're ready to start working with the Java Maven JDBC Library project in IntelliJ IDEA using the Maven file manager. You can browse the source code, make changes, and run the application.</p>

<p>I hope you find this project useful and interesting!</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
